# Have I Been Pwned + Steampipe

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com) (HIBP) is an online searchable index of data breaches where anyone can quickly assess if they may have been put at risk due to an online account of theirs having been compromised or "pwned" in a data breach.

For example:

```sql
select
  name,
  pwn_count as compromised_count,
  is_verified as verified,
  breach_date
from
  hibp_breach
where
  breach_date > '2022-01-01'
```

```
